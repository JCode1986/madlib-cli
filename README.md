# Madlib CLI

**Author**: Joseph Hangarter
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
* Print a welcome message to the user, explaining the Madlib process and command line interactions
* Read a template Madlib file (Example), and parse that file into usable parts.
* You need to decide what components of this file are useful, and how to break those useful pieces apart
* Once you know what parts of the template need user input, such as Adjective, prompt the user to submit a series of words to fit each of the required components of the Madlib template.
* With the collected user inputs, populate the template such that each provided input is placed into the correct position within the template.
* After the resulting Madlib has been completed, provide the completed response back to the user in the command line.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. This is also an area which you can include any visuals; flow charts, example usage gifs, screen captures, etc.-->

## API
<!-- Provide detailed instructions for your applications usage. This should include any methods or endpoints available to the user/client/developer. Each section should be formatted to provide clear syntax for usage, example calls including input data requirements and options, and example responses or return values. -->
