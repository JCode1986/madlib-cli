# Madlib CLI

**Author**: Joseph Hangarter
**Version**: 1.0.3

## Overview
* Print a welcome message to the user, explaining the Madlib process and command line interactions
* Read a template Madlib file (Example), and parse that file into usable parts.
* You need to decide what components of this file are useful, and how to break those useful pieces apart
* Once you know what parts of the template need user input, such as Adjective, prompt the user to submit a series of words to fit each of the required components of the Madlib template.
* With the collected user inputs, populate the template such that each provided input is placed into the correct position within the template.
* After the resulting Madlib has been completed, provide the completed response back to the user in the command line.
